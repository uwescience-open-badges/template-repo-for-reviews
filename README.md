# submissions
This is a repository to receive submissions by uploading to the web ([how to upload?](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/)). Once a submission is recieved, a new repository is created in this organisation to hold the submitted file and the review correspondence. We offer this method of submission because some files may be too big to submit by email (~30 mb) or attach to a GitHub issue post (25 mb limit). If your submission is already in a GitHub or othe repository, please start a [new issue here](https://github.com/uwescience-open-badges/submissions/issues/new) with a URL to your repository. 

Before you submit, please ensure you have prepared your poster/presentation/paper according to [our instructions](https://github.com/uwescience-open-badges/about/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-get-a-badge)
