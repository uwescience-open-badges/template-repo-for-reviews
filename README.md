# Reviewer guidelines

This repository contains a submission to be considered for an Open Data and/or Open Materials badge. Two reviewers will inspect the submission and email their review to `bmarwick@uw.edu`, who will post them anonymously to this repo.

## How to review

Please email your review to `bmarwick@uw.edu`. In reviewing this submission, your task is to:

1. **Confirm** that the submission has a '[disclosure statement](https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/2.%20Awarding%20Badges/)' including one or more persistent URLs to files at a trustworthy repository, and sufficient information for an independent researcher to reproduce the reported results (or an explanation of why not)    
2. **Confirm** that the provided link(s) in the submission lead to the data and/or materials on a public, open access repository; and
3. **Confirm** the linked data and/or materials are related to the topic of the submission. 

You should not attempt to run the code or reproduce the results in the submission (unless you really want to).

If you find that one of the three items is missing, or doesn't quite meet the bar, please try to give clear feedback on how the author could improve their submission. A key goal of our project is to raise the quality of research generally and you (the experienced reviewer) are well placed to give this feedback.

Here is a template review that you're welcome to copy-paste in your email to `bmarwick@uw.edu`:
